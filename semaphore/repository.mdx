A Repository is a place to store and manage Ansible content like playbooks and roles.
Semaphore understands Repositories that are:

- a local Git Repository (git://)
- a local file system (file://)
- a remote Git Repository that is accessed over HTTPS (https://), or SSH(ssh://)
  All Task Templates require a Repository in order to run.

## Create a New Repository

1. Make sure you have configured the key for the Repository you are about to add in the key store section
2. Go to the Repositories section of Semaphore, click the New Repository button in the upper right hand corner
3. Configure the Repository
   -Name Repository
   - Add the URL. The URL must start with the following:
   -https:// for a remote Git Repository accessed over HTTPS
   -ssh:// for a remote Git Repository accessed over SSH
   -file:// for a local folder on the file system
   -git:// for a local Git Repository

- Set the branch of the Repository, if you are not sure what it should be, it is probably master or main
- Select the Access Key you configured prior to setting up this Repository

4. Click Save once everything is configured

## Editing an Existing Repository

1. Go to the Repositories section of Semaphore
2. Click on the pencil icon next to the Repository you wish to change, then you will be presented with the Repository configuration

# Deleteing a Repository

Make sure the Repository that is about to be delete is not in use by any Task Templates. A Repository cannot be deleted if it is used in any Task Templates

1. Go to the Repositories section of Semaphore
2. Click on the trash can icon on of the Repository you wish to delete
3. Click Yes on the confirmation pop-up if you are sure you want this Repository to be deleted.
