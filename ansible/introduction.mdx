## Setup your development

Learn how to set update development environment for wiresk ansible locally.

Step 1. Begin by creating a bare clone of the repository.

```bash
git clone git@bitbucket.org:idcrm/wiresk-ansible.git
```

Step 2. Navigate into the project

```bash
cd wiresk-ansible
```

### Roles

In Ansible, roles are a way to organize and package automation content for reusability. They provide a standardized directory structure, including folders for defaults, variables, tasks, handlers, and more. The following list is the community roles used in Wiresk Ansible

1. [PHP](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/php).
2. [PHP Version](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/php-versions)
3. [Composer](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/composer)
4. [Maria DB](https://galaxy.ansible.com/bertvv/mariadb)
5. [Rabbit MQ](https://galaxy.ansible.com/rockandska/rabbitmq)

```bash
ansible-galaxy role install -r roles/requirements.yml

```

## Credential Files

All configuration values are location inside config/env which are not being included in git. Make sure you copy everything into the directory first.

1. Navigate to your credential folder
2. Copy into the ansible projects with the following command (Change the path depending on your need)

```bash
scp -R ./* debian@dev-openstack-poc-01.wiresk.org:/home/debian/wiresk-ansible/config/env/
```

## Collections

Ansible collection provides a set of commonly used functionalities for configuration management, automation, and orchestration tasks.
The following list is the community collections used in Wiresk Ansible:

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Python Openstack Client. [Preparing
  an environment for using the OpenStack
  API](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/en-public-cloud-compute-prepare-openstack-api-environment?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0050988).
</Info>
1. [Openstack Cloud](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/openstack/cloud/index.html).
2. [Community Generate](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/index.html)

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install -r playbooks/collection/requirements.yml
```

### Other Dependenices

Wiresk Ansible contain PHP script to perform API request along side a few packaes, So we need to composer dependenices by the following command

```bash
composer install
```

## Inventory

An Ansible inventory is a configuration file specifying hosts and their details. It helps Ansible manage and execute tasks on designated hosts, serving as a key component in configuration management and automation. Here's how Wiresk Inventory should looks like

<Info>
You must also ensure that your public SSH key is added to the authorized_keys file on each host

```yaml Inventory.yaml
all:
  hosts:
    control_server:
      ansible_host: control_server_ip
    mariadb_server:
      ansible_host: mariadb_server_ip
    caching_server:
      ansible_host: rabbitmq_server_ip
    proxy_server:
      ansible_host: load_balancer_ip
    api_servers:
      ansible_host:
        - api_server1_ip
        - api_server2_ip
    listeners_servers:
      ansible_host:
        - listener_server1_ip
        - listener_server2_ip
  children:
    application_servers:
      hosts:
        api_servers:
        listeners_servers:
```

```ini Inventory.ini
[control_server]

[api_servers]
api_server1 ansible_host=api_server1_ip
api_server2 ansible_host=api_server2_ip
[listeners_servers]

listener_server2 ansible_host=listener_server2_ip
[application_servers:children]
