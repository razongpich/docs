title: Artisan Command
description: "There are a couple of commands running in schedule to support auto scaling logic."
---

## Listener Scale

```bash
    php artisan listener:scale
```

This command runs every 5 minutes as an auto scaling solution to ensure that the number of listeners will up scale on demand, and also down scale if nesscessary.

## Listener Restart

```bash
    php artisan listener:restart
```

This command runs every 2 hours to detected if there are disconnected listener connections. If found one, it will find the process id and kill it so, the supervisor will perform the listener restart.

## Server Sync

This command runs every 10 minutes to ensure the server created inside database will have the correct IP address. The logic will trigger when:

- Auto scaling logic order a new server
- We deploy a new listener server

```bash
    php artisan server:sync
```

## Connection Sync

This command runs every 5 minutes to synchronize the connections from rabbitmq to the database. The logic will trigger when :

- We deploy a new listener server with listener configurations
- We deploy new listener manually

```bash
    php artisan connection:synchronize
```

[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) lets you create visual diagrams using text and code.

```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    subgraph subgraph1
        direction TB
        top1[top] --> bottom1[bottom]
    end
    subgraph subgraph2
        direction TB
        top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom]
    end
    %% ^ These subgraphs are identical, except for the links to them:

    %% Link *to* subgraph1: subgraph1 direction is maintained
    outside --> subgraph1
    %% Link *within* subgraph2:
    %% subgraph2 inherits the direction of the top-level graph (LR)
    outside ---> top2
```
